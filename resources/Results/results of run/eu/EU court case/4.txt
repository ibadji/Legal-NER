2. Second plea in law, alleging that by requiring Lufthansa to facilitate the sale of NIKI to another buyer, the Condition exceeds the permissible scope of Article 7(3) ECMR and thereby infringes the principle of proportionality.
According to the applicant, conditions under Article 7(3) ECMR are appropriate only to the extent they are needed in a given case to ensure that undue impact on the target’s market conduct and the implementing steps for a notified transaction can be reversed in order to restore the status quo ante.
3. Third plea in law, alleging that the vague standard of ‘market terms’ and the lack of any procedural safeguard or limiting principles by design operates against Lufthansa and thus breaches the principles of proportionality, legal certainty, and Lufthansa’s right to property and freedom to conduct business.
4. Fourth plea in law, alleging that the contested decision lacks adequate reasoning with respect to the number of aircraft covered.
Lufthansa submits that the Commission has failed to state adequate reasons because its interpretation of its own decision creates fundamental uncertainty over the scope of the Condition, which is highly prejudicial to Lufthansa’s ability to seek judicial protection, and the Court’s ability to perform its duty of judicial review.
5. Fifth plea in law, alleging that the applicant’s right to be heard was breached.
Lufthansa submits that the Commission did not respect Lufthansa’s right to be heard and ignored the provisional procedure provided for in Article 18 ECMR and Article 12 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 802/2004 (3) by adopting the contested decision as ‘final’ without having afforded Lufthansa an opportunity to make known its views on the Condition and any alleged competitive harm the Condition was supposed to remedy, neither before (Article 18(1) ECMR) nor after (Article 18(2) ECMR) the adoption of the Decision.
