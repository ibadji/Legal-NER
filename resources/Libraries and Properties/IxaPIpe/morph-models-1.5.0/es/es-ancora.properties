#### FEATURES ####
##################

#FeatureSet: use opennlp set of features or a more extended featureset
#including trigrams and other stuff. If commented out it defaults to baseline.
#Possible values are "Opennlp" or "Baseline".
#FeatureSet=Opennlp

# DictionaryFeatures: Provide path to a tag dictionary in opennlp format.
# This tag dictionary reduces the candidate pos tags for each entry to the tags
# present in the dictionary only. If commented out this feature is not used.
#DictionaryFeatures=/home/ragerri/resources/pos-resources/tag-dicts/es/es-lemmatizer.xml

# AutoDictFeatures: Provide a cutoff to automatically build a pos tag
# dictionary using the training data. The cutoff needs to be >= 1. If
# commented out this feature is not used.
AutoDictFeatures=5

#### CROSS VALIDATION PARAMETERS ####
#####################################

# Cross Validation Folds; if commented out it defaults to 10 cross validation
# folds.
Folds=10
# Evaluation type: choose between 'detailed', 'brief' and 'error'; only for cross-validation.
# It defaults to brief evaluation.
EvaluationType=brief
